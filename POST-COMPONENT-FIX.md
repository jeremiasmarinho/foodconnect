# Post Component TypeError Fix

## Issue

Application was crashing with the error:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')
```

The error was occurring in the Post component when trying to render posts from the feed.

## Root Cause

The issue had multiple layers:

1. **Type Mismatch**: The backend API returns `Post` type with `imageUrls` as a JSON string, but the frontend Post component expected `PostData` type with `images` as a string array.

2. **Missing Transformation**: Posts from the API were not being transformed from backend format to frontend format.

3. **Unsafe Array Access**: The Post component was directly accessing `post.images.map()` without checking if the array existed or was populated.

## Files Changed

### 1. `/frontend/src/services/post.ts`

**Added transformation function**:

- Created `transformPost()` function to convert backend `Post` to frontend `PostData`
- Parses `imageUrls` JSON string into `images` array
- Handles fallback to `imageUrl` if `imageUrls` is empty
- Maps all necessary fields including user, establishment, likes, comments

**Updated return types**:

- Changed `PostService.getFeed()` to return `ApiResponse<PostData[]>`
- Changed `PostService.getFilteredFeed()` to return `ApiResponse<PostData[]>`
- Applied transformation to all posts before returning

### 2. `/frontend/src/hooks/useRealPosts.ts`

**Updated types**:

- Changed from `Post[]` to `PostData[]` for posts state
- Now properly typed to work with transformed data

### 3. `/frontend/src/screens/main/FeedScreen.tsx`

**Updated imports and types**:

- Changed from `Post as PostInterface` to `PostData`
- Updated `renderPost` function parameter type to `PostData`

### 4. `/frontend/src/components/Post.tsx`

**Added safety checks for arrays**:

- Changed `post.images.map()` to `(post.images || []).map()`
- Changed `post.images.length` to `(post.images || []).length`
- Added check for images existence before accessing array index

## Data Flow

### Backend Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "content": "...",
      "imageUrls": "[\"https://...\"]",  // JSON string
      "user": {...},
      "_count": { "likes": 0, "comments": 0 }
    }
  ]
}
```

### After Transformation

```typescript
{
  id: "...",
  content: "...",
  images: ["https://..."],  // Parsed array
  user: {...},
  likesCount: 0,
  commentsCount: 0,
  isLiked: false
}
```

## Result

✅ Posts now render correctly with images
✅ No more TypeError on undefined.map()
✅ Proper type safety throughout the application
✅ Handles edge cases (missing images, empty arrays)

## Testing

1. Backend returns posts with `imageUrls` as JSON string
2. Transformation parses JSON to array
3. Post component safely renders images
4. Feed loads without errors

## Related Issues Fixed

- Infinite loop in feed loading (previous fix)
- AuthProvider consolidation (previous fix)
- API response structure handling (previous fix)
